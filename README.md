# Algorithm_graphs


**Graph algorithms** are step-by-step methods used to solve problems involving graphs, which are structures made up of nodes (vertices) connected by links (edges). These algorithms help in tasks like finding the shortest path, detecting cycles, or building minimum spanning trees. Examples include BFS and DFS for traversal, Dijkstra's for shortest paths, and Kruskal's for minimum spanning trees. They are essential tools in computer science for analyzing and working with network data.
